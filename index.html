                In my role, I orchestrated seamless collaboration among cross-functional teams and adeptly managed concurrent projects, ensuring punctual delivery within defined parameters of scope, budget, and quality. Crafting and disseminating comprehensive project charters to align with client objectives, I fostered transparency and accountability through regular stand-up calls.
                
                My proficiency is underscored by certifications from industry leaders such as Google, Project Management Institute and LinkedIn, affirming my adeptness in project management, Generative AI and technology for product innovation. Passionate about leveraging cutting-edge AI to effect positive societal and environmental change, I thrive in collaborative environments that celebrate innovation and diversity.
